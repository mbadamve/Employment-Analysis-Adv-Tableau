# Labor Statistics using Advanced Tableau

This project is a pilot for labor statistics analystics in the U.S.A. The data source can be found at https://www.bls.gov/. Using web scraping technique in Python, I have downloaded one year of data for the insights. In this repo, I have included the packaged Tableau workbook which included data needed for all the graphs. 

## Objective/Scope: 
The objectives of the project
1. Study labor force statistics in the USA
2. Analyze employment rates for different sectors/regions
3. Compare economic trends in different industries
4. Evaluate and compare year-over-year growth to understand if 
employment and economy is improving, static, or declining
5. Study the statistics of people claiming Economic Impact Payment 
(stimulus payments)

Requirements: Tableau Desktop 2020.4
